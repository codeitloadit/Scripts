# Newsletters

This is a poorly named module, but is use for two primary use cases:

1. Preparing newsletters for a proof.
2. Preparing newsletters for production.

Scripts that have been actively used recently are `proof.py` and `newsletters.py`.

## Expected Input:

The directory in which the script is being run should contain the following:
* statements.pdf - PDF containing all statements created from Optimal File.
* data.csv - Optimal File.
* documents - Documents directory from order package containing a manifest.csv file.
* lookup.csv - Lookup file.

## proof.py

This will create a single proof file containing statements and newsletters inline
for each record in `data.csv` + `statements.pdf`.

## newsletters.py

Prepares newsletter files for production per association.
